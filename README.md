## How can Squadcast help me?
Squadcast has been in use in production for over two years by hundreds of organizations worldwide. Squadcast can help you practise [Site Reliability Engineering](https://landing.google.com/sre/interview/ben-treynor/) more effectively by 
 - organizing your [service catalog](https://support.squadcast.com/docs/adding-a-service) in production and staging environments
 - establish and [track key Service Levels](https://support.squadcast.com/docs/service-levels) across your services with our Service Level Indicators (SLIs) and Service Level Objectives (SLOs) capability that integrates with a [large variety of developer tools](https://github.com/squadcastHQ/awesome-sre-tools)
 - practise [effective on-call escalations](https://support.squadcast.com/docs/escalation-policies) while avoiding alert fatigue should your SLOs breach
 - know your [error budgets](https://support.squadcast.com/docs/slo-dashboard) through a central SLO dashboard for your team
 - practise effective incident communication with relevant stakeholders through [war rooms](https://support.squadcast.com/docs/warroom) and [public and private status pages](https://support.squadcast.com/docs/statuspage)
 - benefit from a [real-time incident timeline](https://support.squadcast.com/docs/incident-timeline) that combines machine and human activity
 - apply [DRY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself) to your incident response process and build an active knowledge repository with [Squadcast Actions](https://support.squadcast.com/docs/what-are-squadcast-actions) and [Squadcast Runbooks](https://support.squadcast.com/docs/squadcast-runbooks)
 - operate a [transparent incident process](https://support.squadcast.com/docs/managing-all-users) across all your tech team and other key stakeholders
 - conduct [blameless post-mortems](https://support.squadcast.com/docs/postmortems) with a recommended compendium of post-mortem templates that suit different sorts of incident blast radius
 - be responsive across the SRE core loop from both [iOS and Android](https://support.squadcast.com/docs/using-the-mobile-app) in addition to [desktop](https://app.squadcast.com) and CLI.


and most of all - `KEEP CALM AND CARRY ON` !
